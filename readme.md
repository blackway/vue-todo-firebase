# [Vue.js](http://vuejs.org) TodoMVC Firebase (+localStorage) Example

Fork of [the Vue.js MVC example](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/tree/master/examples/vue), but using Firebase Realtime Database as data store.

If there is no Internet connection it uses localStorage as data store, until connection is reestablished.
